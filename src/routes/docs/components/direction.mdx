```

### Manual

### CSS Setup

<Callout>
**Manual CSS Setup Required** — The shadcn CLI installs component code and dependencies but cannot update your CSS configuration. This component has no additional CSS requirements beyond the base theme setup. See the [Installation Guide](/docs/getting-started/installation) for the base `app.css` template.
</Callout>

## Usage

```tsx
import { Direction } from "~/components/ui/direction";
```

```tsx
<Direction dir="ltr | rtl">
  {/* Your content */}
</Direction>
```
